## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 🔒 Private Disclosure

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security issues privately by:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@example.com]
2. **Subject**: "Security Vulnerability - Spotify MCP Server"
3. **Include**: Detailed description and reproduction steps

### 📋 What to Include

Please provide as much information as possible:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What could an attacker accomplish?
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- **Environment**: OS, Node.js version, etc.
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots (if applicable)
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for a fix

### ⏱️ Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolved
- **Resolution**: Depends on severity and complexity

### 🛡️ Severity Assessment

We use the following severity levels:

#### Critical
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Privilege escalation
- Data exposure (API keys, tokens)

#### High
- Denial of Service attacks
- Unauthorized access to user data
- Token theft or manipulation

#### Medium
- Information disclosure
- Configuration vulnerabilities
- Cross-site scripting (if applicable)

#### Low
- Minor information leaks
- Best practice violations
- Documentation issues

### 🎯 Scope

#### In Scope
- **Authentication system** (OAuth, PKCE)
- **Token storage and encryption**
- **API key handling**
- **Input validation**
- **Dependencies** with known vulnerabilities
- **Configuration security**

#### Out of Scope
- **Spotify's infrastructure** (report to Spotify directly)
- **Claude Desktop** (report to Anthropic)
- **Social engineering** attacks
- **Physical security**
- **Denial of service** via resource exhaustion

### 🏆 Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help improve our security:

- **Public acknowledgment** in release notes (if desired)
- **Security contributors** section in README
- **CVE credits** for significant vulnerabilities

### 📜 Disclosure Policy

- We practice **responsible disclosure**
- **90-day** coordinated disclosure timeline
- **Public disclosure** after fix is released
- **CVE assignment** for significant vulnerabilities

## 🔐 Security Features
