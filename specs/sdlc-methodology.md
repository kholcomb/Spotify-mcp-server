# SDLC Methodology Configuration

## Document Status
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Last Updated**: 2025-06-23
- **Owner**: Project Manager
- **Reviewers**: All team roles
- **Status**: Active

## Overview

This document defines the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) methodology for the project and ensures all personas and tasks adhere to the selected development process.

## Supported SDLC Methodologies

### 1. GitFlow
**Best for**: Traditional release cycles, stable production environments
- **Branches**: main, develop, feature/*, release/*, hotfix/*
- **Process**: Feature branches → develop → release → main
- **Release Cycle**: Planned releases with release branches
- **Hotfixes**: Direct hotfix branches from main

### 2. GitHub Flow
**Best for**: Continuous deployment, web applications
- **Branches**: main, feature/*
- **Process**: Feature branches → main (via PR)
- **Release Cycle**: Continuous deployment from main
- **Hotfixes**: Feature branches with urgent priority

### 3. GitLab Flow
**Best for**: Multiple environments, staged deployments
- **Branches**: main, feature/*, environment/* (staging, production)
- **Process**: Feature → main → environment promotion
- **Release Cycle**: Environment-based promotions
- **Hotfixes**: Cherry-pick to environment branches

### 4. Agile/Scrum with Git
**Best for**: Sprint-based development, iterative delivery
- **Branches**: main, sprint/*, feature/*, bugfix/*
- **Process**: Sprint planning → feature development → sprint review
- **Release Cycle**: Sprint-based releases
- **Hotfixes**: Emergency hotfix process

### 5. Trunk-Based Development
**Best for**: High-frequency integration, feature flags
- **Branches**: main (trunk), short-lived feature/*
- **Process**: Small, frequent commits to main
- **Release Cycle**: Continuous integration/deployment
- **Hotfixes**: Direct commits to main

```

### Branch Strategy
```yaml

  hotfix:
    naming_convention: "hotfix/{ticket-id}-{description}"
    base_branch: "main"
    merge_to: ["main", "develop"]
```

### Code Review Requirements
```yaml
code_review:
  required_reviewers: 1
  required_personas: ["qa_engineer"]  # Always require QA review
  auto_assign_reviewers: true
  reviewer_assignment_strategy: "round_robin"  # round_robin|load_balanced|expertise_based
  require_approval_from_owners: true
```

### Quality Gates
```yaml
quality_gates:
  pre_commit:
    - lint_check
    - format_check
    - security_scan
  pre_merge:
    - all_tests_pass
    - coverage_threshold: 80
    - security_approval
    - documentation_updated
  pre_release:
    - integration_tests
    - performance_tests
    - security_audit
    - stakeholder_approval
```

## Persona-Specific SDLC Responsibilities

### Project Manager
- **GitFlow**: Manage release planning and branch coordination
- **GitHub Flow**: Coordinate PR priorities and deployment timing
- **Agile/Scrum**: Sprint planning, backlog management, retrospectives
- **All**: Enforce process compliance, track progress against methodology

### Architect
- **All Methodologies**: Design reviews at branch merge points
- **GitFlow**: Architecture decisions in develop branch integration
- **Trunk-Based**: Continuous architecture validation
- **Required Reviews**: All architectural changes require architect approval

### Frontend/Backend Developers
- **Branch Creation**: Follow naming conventions and base branch rules
- **Feature Development**: Implement features according to methodology workflow
- **Code Reviews**: Participate in peer reviews according to SDLC requirements
- **Testing**: Ensure tests pass before requesting merges

### QA Engineer
- **All Methodologies**: Required reviewer for all code changes
- **Testing Strategy**: Align testing approach with release cycle
- **Quality Gates**: Validate all quality gates are met before approvals
- **Bug Tracking**: Follow methodology-specific bug fix workflows

### DevOps Engineer
- **CI/CD Alignment**: Configure pipelines to match SDLC methodology
- **Branch Policies**: Implement and enforce branch protection rules
- **Deployment Strategy**: Align deployments with methodology release cycles
- **Environment Management**: Manage environments according to branch strategy

### Security Engineer
- **Security Reviews**: Required at all merge points to protected branches
- **Vulnerability Management**: Follow methodology-specific security fix workflows
- **Compliance**: Ensure SDLC process meets security compliance requirements
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain security audit trail according to methodology

### Cloud Engineer
- **Infrastructure Changes**: Follow same SDLC process as code changes
- **Environment Promotion**: Align with methodology's environment strategy
- **Disaster Recovery**: Implement recovery procedures matching SDLC approach
- **Resource Management**: Track infrastructure changes through methodology workflow

## Workflow Enforcement Rules

### Mandatory Checks
1. **Branch Protection**: Protected branches cannot be pushed to directly
2. **PR Requirements**: All changes must go through pull requests
3. **Review Requirements**: Minimum reviewer count and required personas must approve
4. **Status Checks**: All automated checks must pass before merge
5. **Linear History**: Maintain clean commit history (configurable)

### Automated Enforcement
```yaml
automation:
  branch_naming_validation: true
  pr_template_enforcement: true
  commit_message_format: "conventional_commits"
  automatic_reviewer_assignment: true
  conflict_resolution_required: true
  
conventional_commits:
  format: "type(scope): description"
  types: ["feat", "fix", "docs", "style", "refactor", "test", "chore"]
  require_scope: false
  max_length: 72
```

### Process Validation
- **Pre-commit**: Validate branch naming, commit message format
- **PR Creation**: Validate base branch, assign reviewers, apply templates
- **Pre-merge**: Validate all reviews, checks, and quality gates
- **Post-merge**: Update related branches, trigger deployments

## Configuration Management

### Project-Level Configuration
Configuration stored in `project/.sdlc-config.yml`:
```yaml
# This file is created during project setup and defines SDLC methodology
project:
  sdlc_methodology: "gitflow"
  created_date: "2025-06-23"
  last_updated: "2025-06-23"
  
# Methodology-specific settings loaded from templates/sdlc/
methodology_config: "./templates/sdlc/gitflow.yml"

# Project-specific overrides
overrides:
  quality_gates:
    coverage_threshold: 85  # Override default 80%
  
# Persona assignments and responsibilities
persona_config: "./templates/sdlc/gitflow-personas.yml"
```

### Runtime Validation
- **Session Initialization**: Load and validate SDLC configuration
- **Task Assignment**: Validate tasks against methodology workflow
- **Branch Operations**: Validate branch operations against configured strategy
- **Review Process**: Enforce reviewer requirements and approval workflows

## Migration Between Methodologies

### Migration Process
1. **Assessment**: Evaluate current state and target methodology
2. **Planning**: Create migration plan with timeline and rollback strategy
3. **Configuration**: Update SDLC configuration and branch policies
4. **Training**: Brief team on new methodology requirements
5. **Cutover**: Implement new process with monitoring period
6. **Validation**: Ensure all personas understand and follow new process

### Migration Considerations
- **Branch Cleanup**: Handle existing branches that don't match new strategy
- **CI/CD Updates**: Update automation to match new methodology
- **Documentation**: Update all process documentation and templates
- **Tool Configuration**: Update repository settings and third-party tools

## Compliance and Reporting

### Process Metrics
- **Cycle Time**: Time from feature start to production deployment
- **Lead Time**: Time from requirement to customer delivery
- **Defect Rate**: Bugs found in production vs. total deliveries
- **Review Coverage**: Percentage of changes properly reviewed
- **Process Adherence**: Compliance with methodology requirements

### Audit Trail
- **Branch History**: Complete record of branch creation and merges
- **Review Records**: All code reviews with approvals and comments
- **Quality Gate Results**: Results of all automated and manual quality checks
- **Deployment History**: Record of all deployments and their sources
